## Note

### Portfolio

- **Split-adjusted share prices**: Not processed in the trading ledger (including users and robots), but processed in the holding ledger calculation.

### Robot Trader

- **About the slippage issue**: Since the underlying traded are daily level ETFs, the impact of slippage issues is minimal.
- **No liquidity issues**: Because simulation trading cannot know the liquidity of the transaction of the day, such as A shares max up and down the restrictions caused the inability to deal, there is a certain deviation from the actual transaction, which is also the charm of the real deal, there is a certain amount of uncertainty brought about by the change.
